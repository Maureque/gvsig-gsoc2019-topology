# New rules for the Topology Framework in gvSIG Desktop 
## Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2019 - OSGeo

* Proposal: [Create new rules for the Topology Framework in gvSIG Desktop](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GvSIG_GSoC_2019_Ideas)

## Introduction
A new topology toolbox. This tool will provide a group of integrity rules that will check the validation of the geometries relationship in the data. A new topology data model can be created for each project. This toolbox provide a new set of tools to navigate, find and fix validation errors different from each topology rule. Right now, there are just a few topology rules implemented with a limited actions. This project will analize, implement and optimize a new set of rules that will be incorporated to this framework. This tools can be created in Java or in Jython through the Scripting composer tool.

## Getting started

Some comments and resources are included in order to help with gvSIG's downloading/launching process and test's downloading/running process.

### Pre-requisites

* JRE/OpenJRE 7 or later
* [gvSIG 2.4.0](http://www.gvsig.com/en/products/gvsig-desktop/downloads) - Download

Download and install the appropriate **JRE/OpenJRE** version for the corresponding **OS** and **architecture**.  
Download the appropriate version of **gvSIG Portable** for the corresponding **OS** and **architecture**.  
Uncompress the ZIP file, **NOT** directly in ```C:\``` (Windows) or ```/dev/sda/``` (Linux) and in a path with **NO** spaces.  
E.g., create a ```gvsig-desktop``` folder in ```C:\``` (Windows) or ```/dev/sda/``` (Linux) and uncompress there.  
Inside gvSIG's decompressed folder, search for ```gvsig-desktop.cmd``` (Windows) or ```gvSIG.sh``` (Linux) and execute it.
